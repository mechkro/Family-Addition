Shay,

  We have never met but we are family non the less. I understand you recently graduated from High School, which
  may not seem like a big deal but its an incredible achievment. 
  
  Never stop learning! This world rewards value, and the more valuable you make yourself the more you will reap.
  I wasn't the best kid growing up and made life hard on my parents. I would wonder the older I got why they
  put up with it, I know I wouldn't have. However expecting a child of my own I realize family is the only thing
  and only poeple that will be there through the thick and the thin. As I said, we are family. We may not know each
  other but if you ever find yourself needing family, we'll be there.
  
  If I understood correctly, you have decided to do a trade school of some kind, HVAC if im not mistaken? That's
  great to hear! It's a valuable skill to have, and one that will provide for you and your future family for
  many years to come. 
  
  If I can I leave you with one piece of advice, it would be to never stop learning and never stop growing
  as a person. Enjoy the little things and all the poeple that make you happy. I wasted a lot of years being 
  angry at the world. Not appreciating what I did have right in front of me, Family. Tell them you love them as 
  much as possible, because life comes quick and comes hard. 
  
  If you ever need any technical help, have questions about career change or even are looking for a job out west;
  give me a call! I work in a similar field and will be more than willing to extend my hand.
  
  Best Wishes,
  Tony Kinsey
  Your coming into a time in ones life where
